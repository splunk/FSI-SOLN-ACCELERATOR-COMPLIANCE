                        merely a legal obligation but a fundamental necessity for maintaining
                        customer trust and avoiding significant penalties.</p>

                    <p>A critical aspect of achieving and maintaining this compliance posture lies
                        in how data enters (is "ingested" into) your systems. Data arrives from
                        diverse sources - customer interactions, transactions, application logs,
                        third-party feeds,
                        and more. Without proper controls and definitions applied at the point of
                        ingestion, it becomes challenging to track, classify, secure, and manage
                        this data effectively throughout its lifecycle in accordance with compliance
                        mandates.</p>

                    <p>In light of the widespread and increasingly complex global landscape of data

                        laws, regulations, industry standards, and internal policies governing data
                        security and privacy. This necessitates the meticulous implementation and

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 1: Archive Original KYC Event to S3</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To create an immutable, complete, and
                                    unaltered record of the original <a
                                        href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KYC</a> event.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why First?</strong> For regulatory compliance, audits,
                                    and legal discovery, it's often mandatory to store the exact
                                    data as it was received. Sending the original event to long-term
                                    storage (like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) <em>
                                    before</em> any modifications ensures data integrity and
                                    provides a verifiable source of truth.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> with <code>send_original_event:
                                    true</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> This is crucial. It
                                    ensures that after the original event is routed to <a
                                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">S3</a>, the event continues to the
                                    next rule in the pipeline for further processing (masking,
                                    hashing, and routing to Splunk).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <strong>Rule 2: Mask and Hash PII for Splunk Ingestion</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To protect sensitive <a

                                    before the data is indexed in Splunk for operational analytics.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why After S3 Archival?</strong> This ensures the
                                    original <a

                                    archived (as per Rule 1), while the data sent to Splunk adheres
                                    to data minimization principles, reducing the risk of <a
                                        href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/personally_identifiable_information"

                                    in a more widely accessible operational system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Actions:</strong> <code>eval</code> is used
                                    to apply transformations: <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Masking:</strong> Replacing sensitive strings
                                    (e.g., <code>pii.full_name</code>, <code>address.street_address</code>)
                                    with placeholders like "REDACTED" or using partial masking.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Converting sensitive unique
                                    identifiers (e.g., <code>pii.email</code>, <code>
                                    documents.document_id</code>) into non-reversible hash values
                                    (e.g., using <code>sha256()</code>). Hashing allows for
                                    correlation (e.g., identifying if the same email appears
                                    multiple times) without exposing the original data. New fields
                                    (e.g., <code>pii.email_hash</code>) can be created to store
                                    these hashes.</li>

                            <strong>PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
                                Compliance</strong>
                        </a> using Splunk Ingest
                        Actions. The underlying driver for this is the comprehensive protection of
                        Cardholder Data (CHD), a critical mandate designed to safeguard sensitive
                        payment information and prevent fraud for any entity that stores, processes,
                        or transmits cardholder data.</p>

                    <p>PCI DSS clearly outlines stringent requirements for securing cardholder data,
                        focusing on twelve key requirements that cover network security, data
                        protection, vulnerability management, access controls, monitoring, and
                        security policies. </p>
                    <p>Specifically, data elements like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Primary Account Number (PAN)</li>
                        <li>Cardholder Name</li>
                        <li>Service Code</li>
                        <li>Expiration Date</li>

                        , <b>must never be stored after authorization</b>, even if encrypted. This
                        "no storage" rule is a fundamental pillar of PCI DSS compliance.</p>

                    <p>Thisincludes items like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full contents of any track from the magnetic stripe or chip (e.g., Track

                        <li>CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID (three- or four-digit security code)</li>
                        <li>PINs / PIN blocks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Given these stringent requirements, the process of data ingestion becomes
                        paramount. It necessitates careful consideration of how data related to
                        payment transactions and system activities is collected, how it is
                        pre-processed to meet PCI DSS standards before being indexed, and where
                        different tiers of sensitive data are ultimately stored (e.g., tokenized vs.
                        raw PAN).</p>

                    <p>In this specific use case, we will demonstrate how Splunk Ingest Actions can

                            Service Code are typically present. PCI DSS mandates strict protection
                            for this data if stored, processed, or transmitted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Potential for Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD):</strong>
                            Depending on the capture point, data like CVV2 (Card Verification Value
                            2) or full magnetic stripe data (Track 1/Track 2) might be present in
                            raw transaction logs <em>before</em> authorization is complete. PCI DSS
                            explicitly prohibits the storage of SAD post-authorization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Audit Trail for Transactions:</strong> These logs form a
                            critical part of the audit trail required by PCI DSS (e.g., Requirement
                            10) to track access to network resources and cardholder data.</li>

                        DSS requirements (e.g., displaying only the first six and last four digits
                        if there's a legitimate business need for storage), and route data

                        pci_dss_data_processing_amer</code>) is strategically designed with four
                        sequential rules. This structure ensures compliance with key <strong>
                            <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_dss/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">PCI DSS</a>
                        </strong>

                        Data (SAD) from raw transaction logs (e.g., <code>
                        sourcetype="pci:transaction:raw"</code>).</p>
                    <h3>Pipeline Logic and Rule Breakdown:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 1: Archive Original Transaction Log to S3</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To create an immutable, complete, and
                                    unaltered record of the original transaction event.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why First?</strong> PCI DSS Requirement 10 mandates
                                    comprehensive logging and audit trails. Storing the exact data
                                    as received in a secure, long-term archive (like <a
                                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) <em>before</em> any
                                    modifications ensures data integrity for audits, forensics, and
                                    dispute resolution.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> with <code>send_original_event:
                                    true</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> This is critical. It
                                    ensures that after the original event is routed to S3, the event
                                    continues to the next rules in the pipeline for necessary
                                    sanitization (SAD removal, PAN masking) before being indexed in
                                    Splunk.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 2: Detect and Remove/Redact Sensitive Authentication Data
                                (SAD)</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To eliminate any SAD (e.g., CVV, full
                                    track data) from the event stream destined for Splunk.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why After S3 Archival &amp; Before Splunk Indexing?</strong>
                                    PCI DSS Requirement 3.2 strictly prohibits storing SAD
                                    post-authorization. This rule acts on the event after its
                                    original form has been archived (Rule 1), ensuring that the data
                                    indexed into Splunk for operational analytics does not contain
                                    this prohibited information, thereby minimizing risk and meeting
                                    compliance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Actions:</strong> <code>eval</code> to set
                                    SAD fields to a redacted placeholder or <code>null()</code>, or
                                    the <code>fields</code> processor with <code>action: remove</code>
                                    to completely remove these fields.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> The event, now
                                    stripped of SAD, proceeds to the next rule for PAN masking.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 3: Mask Primary Account Number (PAN)</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To protect the PAN by masking it
                                    according to PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 (e.g., displaying only the
                                    first six and last four digits).</li>
                                <li><strong>Why After SAD Removal &amp; Before Splunk Indexing?</strong>
                                    With SAD removed, the next critical step is to protect the PAN.
                                    Masking allows for the PAN to be partially visible for
                                    legitimate business purposes (like transaction lookup or
                                    analytics) within Splunk, without exposing the full PAN in the
                                    operational system. The original full PAN is already archived
                                    (Rule 1).</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>eval</code> with
                                    functions like <code>replace()</code> to apply the masking
                                    format.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> The event, now with
                                    SAD removed and PAN masked, proceeds to the final routing rule.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 4: Route Processed Transaction Event to Splunk Index</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To send the modified (SAD-removed,
                                    PAN-masked), PCI DSS-friendlier version of the transaction event
                                    to the designated Splunk index (e.g., <code>
                                    pci_processed_transactions_amer</code>).</li>
                                <li><strong>Why Last (for this flow)?</strong> This rule acts on the
                                    data that has been appropriately prepared: original archived,
                                    SAD removed, and PAN masked. The data is now suitable for
                                    real-time monitoring, alerting, security analytics, and PCI DSS
                                    compliance dashboards within Splunk.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> to a <code>
                                    splunk_index</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: true</code>:</strong> This indicates that
                                    no further processing is needed for this event within this
                                    specific pipeline after it has been successfully routed to
                                    Splunk.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                        strictly adhering to SAD non-storage requirements (PCI DSS Req 3.2),
                        protecting PAN (PCI DSS Req 3.3, 3.4), and making relevant, sanitized data

                    <p>In this use case, we will define and implement a strategy for supporting
                        compliance with the <strong>
                            <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2554/oj" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</a>
                        </strong>
                        using Splunk Ingest Actions. DORA is a significant EU regulation applicable
                        to almost all financial entities (FEs) and critical third-party ICT service
                        providers (CTPPs). Its primary goal is to harmonize and strengthen digital
                        operational resilience across the EU financial sector.</p>
                    <p>DORA establishes binding rules across several key pillars:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ICT Risk Management:</strong> Requiring FEs to have
                            comprehensive ICT risk management frameworks.</li>
                        <li><strong>ICT-Related Incident Management and Reporting:</strong>
                            Mandating processes for monitoring, classifying, and reporting major
                            ICT-related incidents to competent authorities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Digital Operational Resilience Testing:</strong> Requiring
                            regular testing of ICT systems and resilience capabilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>ICT Third-Party Risk Management:</strong> Setting out
                            requirements for managing risks associated with CTPPs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information and Intelligence Sharing:</strong> Encouraging
                            voluntary sharing of cyber threat information.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Given these requirements, particularly around ICT-related incident management
                        and reporting, the process of data ingestion is crucial. It necessitates
                        careful handling of logs and events from a multitude of ICT systems and
                        services.</p>
                    <p>In this specific use case, we will demonstrate how Splunk Ingest Actions can
                        be used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ensure Comprehensive Capture:</strong> Guarantee that all
                            relevant ICT operational and security logs (e.g., from applications,
                            infrastructure, security tools, cloud services) are ingested. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Classify and Enrich Events:</strong> Automatically classify
                            incoming events based on DORA criteria (e.g., identifying potential
                            ICT-related incidents, assessing severity) and enrich them with relevant
                            metadata for DORA reporting. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Standardize Data:</strong> Transform varied log formats into a
                            consistent structure to facilitate analysis and reporting as per DORA
                            requirements. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Route Data Strategically:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Route original, unaltered logs to secure, long-term storage
                                    (e.g., <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">S3</a>) for auditability and
                                    detailed forensic analysis, supporting DORA's record-keeping
                                    obligations.</li>
                                <li>Route classified and enriched events to specific Splunk indexes
                                    designed for DORA compliance monitoring, incident management
                                    workflows, and generating reports for competent authorities.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>(Optional) Redact Sensitive Information:</strong> Mask or remove
                            overly sensitive operational details from events routed for general
                            analytics if not strictly necessary for DORA-specific views, while
                            ensuring all necessary data for DORA reporting is preserved. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By applying these actions at the point of ingestion, financial entities can
                        build a robust foundation for DORA compliance, enabling timely detection,
                        response, and reporting of ICT-related incidents, and maintaining a clear
                        audit trail of their operational resilience measures.</p>

                        sourcetype="dora:synthetic:event"</code>, represents a synthetic ICT-related

                        </strong>.
                        Such events could originate from various sources, including infrastructure
                        monitoring tools, application logs, security information and event
                        management (SIEM) systems, cloud service provider logs, or logs from
                        critical third-party ICT service providers.</p>
                    <p>The key aspects of this data sample for DORA purposes are its ability to
                        capture information necessary for ICT-related incident management,
                        classification, impact assessment, and reporting. DORA requires financial
                        entities to establish and implement an ICT-related incident management
                        process to detect, manage, and notify ICT-related incidents.</p>
                    <p>For DORA, an event like this would be analyzed to determine if it constitutes
                        an "ICT-related incident" and, if so, whether it qualifies as a "major
                        ICT-related incident" based on criteria such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The number and/or relevance of clients or financial counterparts
                            affected.</li>
                        <li>The duration of the incident, including service downtime.</li>
                        <li>The geographical spread of the incident.</li>
                        <li>Data losses in terms of availability, authenticity, integrity, or
                            confidentiality.</li>
                        <li>The criticality of the services affected.</li>
                        <li>The economic (especially direct and indirect costs and losses) impact.</li>
                    </ul>

                                    Archiving the original event to a secure, long-term storage
                                    solution like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> <em>
                                    before</em> any modifications ensures data integrity. This is
                                    vital for post-incident analysis, audits by competent
                                    authorities, and demonstrating due diligence.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> with <code>send_original_event:
                                    true</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> This is crucial. It
                                    ensures that after the original event is archived, it continues
                                    to the subsequent rules in the pipeline for DORA-specific
                                    classification, enrichment, and routing to operational Splunk
                                    indexes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 2: Classify ICT Event and Enrich for DORA Significance</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To automatically assess and classify
                                    incoming ICT events based on DORA's criteria for incident
                                    significance (particularly for identifying "major ICT-related
                                    incidents" as per Art. 18 and the Annex) and to enrich events
                                    with DORA-relevant metadata.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why After S3 Archival?</strong> This rule operates on
                                    the event data after its original state has been preserved. The
                                    enrichment process involves adding new fields (e.g., <code>
                                    dora_incident_classification</code>, <code>
                                    is_reportable_dora_incident</code>) based on the event's content
                                    and predefined logic reflecting DORA thresholds. This
                                    pre-processing at ingest time standardizes the information
                                    needed for DORA compliance dashboards and alerting.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Actions:</strong> <code>eval</code> (using <code>
                                    case</code> or <code>if</code> statements, potentially combined
                                    with mathematical operations on fields like <code>
                                    num_clients_affected</code>) to derive classification.
                                    Optionally, <code>lookup</code> can be used for more dynamic or
                                    complex classification rules.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> The event, now
                                    enriched with DORA-specific classifications and metadata,
                                    proceeds to the next rule for routing into a dedicated Splunk
                                    index.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 3: Route Processed ICT Event to DORA Compliance Index</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To send the enriched and classified
                                    version of the ICT event to a designated Splunk index (e.g., <code>
                                    dora_ict_incidents_emea</code>) specifically for DORA compliance
                                    monitoring, incident management, and reporting.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why Last (for this flow)?</strong> This rule ensures
                                    that only events processed and deemed relevant for DORA
                                    monitoring (with appropriate classifications) are sent to this
                                    specialized index. This facilitates focused analysis, helps in
                                    building DORA-specific dashboards, and streamlines the process
                                    of identifying and preparing reports for major ICT-related
                                    incidents as required by Art. 19.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> to a <code>
                                    splunk_index</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: true</code>:</strong> This indicates that,
                                    for this DORA-focused pipeline, no further processing is needed
                                    for the event after it has been successfully routed to the
                                    designated Splunk index. (Note: In more complex scenarios, one
                                    might have additional routing rules if the same event, or parts
                                    of it, needs to go to other destinations).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This three-step approach within the <code>dora_ict_event_processing_emea</code>
                        pipeline provides a robust framework for handling ICT-related events in line
                        with DORA. It ensures: <ul>
                            <li><strong>Auditability and Data Integrity:</strong> Through the
                        archival of original events.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proactive Incident Classification:</strong> By automatically
                        assessing events against DORA criteria at ingest time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Streamlined Compliance Monitoring:</strong> By routing
                        relevant, enriched data to a dedicated location for DORA-specific analytics
                        and reporting.</li>
                        </ul> This helps financial
                        entities to more effectively manage their ICT risks, respond to incidents,
                        and meet DORA's stringent operational resilience and reporting obligations. </p>

                            availability, and recoverability of critical IT systems, including
                            incident management, problem management, capacity planning, and data
                            centre operations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cybersecurity Management:</strong> Implementing controls to
                            protect against cyber threats, including threat detection, prevention,

                        <li><strong>IT Project Management and Change Management:</strong> Managing
                            risks associated with IT projects and changes to the production
                            environment, ensuring proper testing and authorization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Third-Party Vendor Risk Management:</strong> Overseeing risks
                            arising from reliance on third-party technology service providers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Audit and Compliance Logging:</strong> Maintaining comprehensive
                            audit trails for system activities, user access, and administrative
                            actions to support investigations and demonstrate compliance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Given these comprehensive requirements, particularly around audit trails,
                        incident management, and change control, the process of data ingestion is
                        fundamental. It requires careful handling of logs from diverse IT systems,
                        applications, and security tools.</p>
                    <p>In this specific use case, we will demonstrate how Splunk Ingest Actions can
                        be used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ensure Comprehensive Logging:</strong> Capture all necessary
                            logs from critical systems, applications, network devices, and security
                            tools as mandated by RMiT for audit and monitoring. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Standardize and Normalize Data:</strong> Transform varied log
                            formats into a consistent structure, making it easier to correlate
                            events and perform unified analysis across different technology domains. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Enrich Events with RMiT Context:</strong> Augment logs with
                            crucial metadata such as system criticality (e.g., identifying if a
                            system supports critical business functions), data sensitivity
                            classifications, change request IDs, or user roles to provide context
                            for risk assessment and compliance monitoring. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mask or Redact Sensitive Information:</strong> Apply masking to
                            sensitive operational details or non-essential PII within logs destined
                            for general monitoring, while ensuring that original, unaltered logs are
                            archived for detailed audit and forensic needs. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Route Data Strategically:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Send original, unaltered logs to secure, long-term storage
                                    (e.g., <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">S3</a>) to meet RMiT's stringent
                                    record-keeping and audit trail requirements.</li>
                                <li>Direct processed, enriched, and appropriately sanitized logs to
                                    specific Splunk indexes designed for RMiT compliance dashboards,
                                    operational monitoring, security incident response, and risk
                                    reporting.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        sourcetype="rmit:synthetic:event"</code>, represents a synthetic event

                        </strong> guidelines. Such an
                        event could simulate various scenarios critical to RMiT, such as a system
                        configuration change, an unauthorized access attempt, a critical system
                        error, a security alert from an intrusion detection system, or a performance
                        degradation issue on a key application.</p>
                    <p>The key aspects of this data sample for RMiT purposes are its ability to
                        capture information necessary for monitoring technology risks, managing
                        incidents, overseeing changes, and ensuring systems operate securely and
                        reliably. RMiT frameworks require financial institutions to have robust
                        monitoring and logging capabilities.</p>
                    <p>For RMiT, an event like this would be analyzed to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identify Deviations from Policies:</strong> Detect activities
                            that violate internal security policies or RMiT guidelines (e.g.,
                            unauthorized changes, access violations).</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor System Health and Availability:</strong> Track events
                            that could indicate system instability, capacity issues, or potential
                            service disruptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support Incident Response:</strong> Provide data for
                            investigating security incidents or operational problems, understanding
                            their impact, and taking corrective actions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Audit Change Management:</strong> Correlate system events with
                            authorized change requests to ensure changes are implemented as
                            approved.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assess Control Effectiveness:</strong> Use log data to verify
                            that security and operational controls are functioning as intended.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ingest Actions will be used to parse these events, extract or derive key
                        fields relevant to RMiT controls (e.g., change ID, system criticality, event
                        severity), enrich them with contextual information, and route them
                        appropriately for compliance monitoring and risk management activities.</p>

                            <strong>Rule 2: Extract Key Entities and Enrich with RMiT Context</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To parse critical information from the
                                    event and augment it with contextual data relevant to RMiT. This
                                    includes identifying systems, users, associated changes, and
                                    classifying event severity or linking to asset criticality.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why After S3 Archival?</strong> This rule operates on
                                    the event data once its original form is safely archived. The
                                    enrichment process adds valuable metadata (e.g., <code>
                                    system_criticality</code>, <code>event_severity</code>) that is
                                    crucial for effective risk assessment, prioritizing alerts, and
                                    monitoring compliance with specific RMiT controls (e.g.,
                                    ensuring changes to critical systems are properly logged and
                                    authorized).</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Actions:</strong> <code>eval</code> for
                                    extractions and conditional logic, <code>lookup</code> to enrich
                                    data from external sources like a CMDB or asset inventory.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> The event, now
                                    enriched with RMiT-specific context, proceeds to the next rule
                                    (optional masking) or directly to routing.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 3: (Optional) Mask Sensitive Operational Data</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To redact or mask specific sensitive
                                    operational details or incidental PII from the event copy that
                                    will be indexed in Splunk for general monitoring, if such data
                                    is not broadly required for RMiT dashboards or analytics.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why Optional and Before Final Routing?</strong> This
                                    step supports data minimization principles. If full operational
                                    details are not needed for all views, masking them reduces
                                    exposure in more widely accessed Splunk indexes. The complete,
                                    unmasked original event is still available in the S3 archive
                                    (Rule 1) for deep-dive investigations or specific audit
                                    requests.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Actions:</strong> <code>eval</code> to
                                    replace or pseudonymize sensitive field values.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> The event, now
                                    potentially with some data masked, proceeds to the final routing
                                    rule.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 4: Route Processed Event to RMiT Monitoring Index</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To send the enriched (and optionally
                                    masked) version of the event to a designated Splunk index (e.g., <code>
                                    rmit_compliance_monitoring_apac</code>). This index serves as
                                    the primary data source for RMiT-focused dashboards, alerts, and
                                    compliance reporting.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why Last (for this flow)?</strong> This rule ensures
                                    that only events that have been appropriately prepared (original
                                    archived, enriched with RMiT context, and optionally sanitized)
                                    are sent to this specialized index. This facilitates efficient
                                    and targeted monitoring of technology risks, operational health,
                                    and compliance status against RMiT guidelines.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> to a <code>
                                    splunk_index</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: true</code>:</strong> This indicates that
                                    no further processing is needed for this event within this
                                    pipeline after it has been successfully routed to the RMiT
                                    monitoring index.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This multi-step approach within the <code>rmit_event_processing_apac</code>
                        pipeline provides a structured framework for handling technology-related
                        events in alignment with RMiT principles. It ensures: <ul>
                            <li><strong>Auditability and Governance:</strong> Through comprehensive
                        archival of original events.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced Risk Insight:</strong> By enriching events with
                        critical context for better risk assessment and incident prioritization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Minimization (Optional):</strong> By allowing for
                        masking of sensitive data in operational views while retaining originals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focused Compliance Monitoring:</strong> By routing relevant,
                        processed data to a dedicated location for RMiT-specific analytics and
                        reporting.</li>
                        </ul> This helps financial
                        institutions in the APAC region to strengthen their technology risk
                        management practices, improve operational oversight, and demonstrate
                        compliance with RMiT requirements. </p>

                        Risk Management)</a>
                        </strong>. This standard,
                        applicable to APRA-regulated entities in Australia, aims to ensure that
                        these entities effectively manage their operational risks, maintain critical
                        operations through disruptions, and manage the risks associated with
                        material service providers.</p>
                    <p>Key requirements of CPS 230 include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Operational Risk Management Framework:</strong> Establishing and
                            maintaining an effective framework to manage operational risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Continuity Management:</strong> Identifying critical
                            operations and establishing plans and capabilities to ensure their
                            continuity through disruptions. This includes setting tolerance levels
                            for disruptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Management of Service Provider Arrangements:</strong> Managing
                            risks associated with material service providers, including due
                            diligence, contractual arrangements, and ongoing monitoring.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incident Management:</strong> Having robust processes to detect,
                            respond to, and recover from operational incidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notification Requirements:</strong> Notifying APRA of
                            significant operational incidents and disruptions to critical
                            operations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Given these requirements, particularly around identifying and managing
                        operational risks, ensuring business continuity, and overseeing service
                        providers, the ingestion and analysis of relevant data are critical.</p>
                    <p>In this specific use case, we will demonstrate how Splunk Ingest Actions can
                        be used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Capture Comprehensive Operational Data:</strong> Ensure logs
                            from critical systems, applications, infrastructure, and service
                            provider interfaces are ingested to provide visibility into operational
                            health and potential risks. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Identify Events Impacting Critical Operations:</strong> Enrich
                            incoming events with information about which critical business
                            operations (as defined in the entity's BCP) they might affect. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Standardize and Correlate Incident Data:</strong> Transform
                            diverse log formats into a consistent structure to facilitate the
                            correlation of events related to a single operational incident or
                            disruption. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Monitor Service Provider Performance:</strong> Process logs
                            related to material service providers to monitor their performance
                            against SLAs and identify potential risks. </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Route Data for Risk Assessment and Reporting:</strong>

                                <li>Archive original, unaltered logs to secure, long-term storage
                                    (e.g., <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">S3</a>) for audit, post-incident
                                    reviews, and demonstrating compliance with CPS 230.</li>
                                <li>Route enriched and classified events to specific Splunk indexes
                                    for operational risk dashboards, business continuity monitoring,
                                    incident management, and service provider oversight.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>(Optional) Flag Events for APRA Notification:</strong> Based on
                            predefined criteria (e.g., impact on critical operations, duration of
                            outage), flag events that may require notification to APRA. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By applying these actions at ingest, entities can build a strong data
                        foundation to support their CPS 230 obligations, enabling proactive
                        operational risk management, enhancing resilience, and ensuring timely

                        Risk Management)</a>
                        </strong>. Such an event could
                        simulate various operational risk scenarios, such as a failure in a critical
                        IT system, a disruption to a key business process, an issue with a material
                        service provider, a control failure, or an event exceeding defined tolerance
                        levels for a critical operation.</p>
                    <p>The key aspects of this data sample for CPS 230 purposes are its ability to
                        capture information necessary for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and
                        managing operational risks, particularly those that could lead to
                        disruptions in critical operations or breaches of tolerance levels.</p>
                    <p>For CPS 230, an event like this would be analyzed to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identify Impact on Critical Operations:</strong> Determine if
                            the event affects any predefined critical business operations and the
                            extent of that impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assess Severity and Duration:</strong> Understand the severity
                            of the operational event/incident and its actual or potential duration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor Tolerance Levels:</strong> Check if the event has caused
                            a breach of established tolerance levels for disruptions to critical
                            operations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Track Service Provider Issues:</strong> If related to a material
                            service provider, capture details relevant to their performance and
                            adherence to contractual obligations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support Incident Management and BCP Activation:</strong> Provide
                            data for incident response, problem resolution, and decisions regarding
                            the activation of business continuity plans.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inform APRA Notifications:</strong> Help determine if the
                            incident meets the criteria for notification to APRA.</li>
                    </ul>

                        cps230_operational_risk_event_processing_anz</code>) is structured with four
                        sequential rules. This design systematically processes incoming operational

                        emphasizes data integrity for audit, contextual enrichment related to
                        critical operations and service providers, incident severity classification,

                    <h3>Pipeline Logic and Rule Breakdown:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 1: Archive Original Operational Event to S3</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To create an immutable, complete, and
                                    unaltered record of every incoming operational event relevant to
                                    CPS 230.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why First?</strong> CPS 230 requires robust
                                    record-keeping for operational risk incidents, disruptions, and
                                    service provider oversight. Archiving the original event to
                                    secure long-term storage (like <a
                                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) <em>before</em> any
                                    modifications ensures data integrity for APRA reviews, internal
                                    audits, and detailed post-incident analysis.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> with <code>send_original_event:
                                    true</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> This is crucial. It
                                    ensures that after the original event is archived, it continues
                                    through the pipeline for CPS 230-specific enrichment,
                                    classification, and routing to operational Splunk indexes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 2: Enrich with Business Context (Critical Operations,
                                Service Providers)</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To parse the event and augment it with
                                    critical business context as defined by CPS 230. This includes
                                    linking events to specific critical business operations, their
                                    defined disruption tolerance levels, and details of any material
                                    service providers involved.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why After S3 Archival?</strong> This rule operates on
                                    the event data once its original form is safely archived. The
                                    enrichment process adds vital metadata (e.g., <code>
                                    critical_operation_id</code>, <code>disruption_tolerance_minutes</code>
                                    , <code>service_provider_name</code>) that is essential for
                                    assessing the impact of operational events, monitoring
                                    compliance with business continuity plans, and overseeing
                                    service provider risks as mandated by CPS 230.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Actions:</strong> <code>lookup</code> to
                                    enrich data from business continuity plans or service provider
                                    inventories, <code>eval</code> to flag events affecting critical
                                    operations.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> The event, now
                                    enriched with CPS 230-specific business context, proceeds to the
                                    next rule for incident classification.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 3: Classify Operational Event/Incident Severity for CPS 230</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To automatically classify the severity
                                    of an operational event or incident based on its actual or
                                    potential impact on critical operations, comparison against
                                    disruption tolerance levels, and other criteria relevant to the
                                    entity's CPS 230 framework.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why After Enrichment?</strong> The classification relies
                                    on the enriched context from Rule 2 (e.g., knowing if a critical
                                    operation is affected and its tolerance level). This step helps
                                    in prioritizing incidents, triggering appropriate response
                                    plans, and identifying events that might require notification to
                                    APRA.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Actions:</strong> <code>eval</code> with <code>
                                    case</code> statements to set a <code>cps230_incident_severity</code>
                                    field and an <code>apra_notification_candidate</code> flag based
                                    on predefined logic.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: false</code>:</strong> The event, now
                                    classified by severity, proceeds to the final routing rule.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rule 4: Route Processed Event to CPS 230 Monitoring Index</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To send the enriched and classified
                                    version of the operational event to a designated Splunk index
                                    (e.g., <code>cps230_operational_risk_monitoring_anz</code>).
                                    This index serves as the core data source for CPS 230-related
                                    operational risk dashboards, incident tracking, BCM monitoring,
                                    and service provider oversight.</li>
                                <li><strong>Why Last (for this flow)?</strong> This rule ensures
                                    that only events that have been appropriately prepared (original
                                    archived, enriched with business context, and classified by
                                    severity) are sent to this specialized index. This facilitates
                                    efficient and targeted monitoring of operational risks and
                                    compliance with CPS 230 requirements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Key Processor Action:</strong> <code>route</code> to a <code>
                                    splunk_index</code>.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>Final: true</code>:</strong> This indicates that
                                    no further processing is needed for this event within this
                                    pipeline after it has been successfully routed to the CPS 230
                                    monitoring index.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This multi-step approach within the <code>
                        cps230_operational_risk_event_processing_anz</code> pipeline provides a
                        structured framework for handling operational events in alignment with APRA
                        CPS 230. It ensures: <ul>
                            <li><strong>Auditability and Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Through
                        comprehensive archival of original events.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced Operational Risk Insight:</strong> By enriching
                        events with critical business context, enabling better impact assessment and
                        alignment with BCPs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proactive Incident Management:</strong> Through automated
                        severity classification and flagging of potential APRA-notifiable events.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focused Monitoring and Reporting:</strong> By routing
                        relevant, processed data to a dedicated location for CPS 230-specific
                        analytics, dashboards, and reporting.</li>
                        </ul> This
                        helps APRA-regulated entities in the A/NZ region to strengthen their
                        operational risk management framework, enhance their resilience, and
                        demonstrate compliance with CPS 230. </p>
